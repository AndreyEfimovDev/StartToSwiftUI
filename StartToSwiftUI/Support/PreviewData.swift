                SwfitUI TextEditor is a great tool for letting your users edit large text elements, but sometimes you want to limit the character count — your backend API might have a limit. For example, Twitter (now X) has a character limit of 280.

                In this blog post, you will learn how to create a TextEditor with a limit of 280 characters. We’ll create the TextEditor in its own view so you can easily use it in different places inside your application. We will also create the character limit as a custom modifier — that way you can have different text editors with different limits.

                In this tutorial, you will learn how to use List in SwiftUI. I have included the most basic usages of List that includes list with strings, objects, sections, styles, delete, selection and of course pull to refresh.

                A List in SwiftUI is a container view that presents rows of data arranged in a single column. It can be used to display a vertically scrolling list of items, where each item is a separate row. A List is a fundamental building block of a SwiftUI app, and it provides several features out-of-the-box, such as automatic scrolling, dynamic row heights, and support for sectioned lists.

                Error handling in Swift is a mechanism for dealing with errors or exceptional situations that may occur in your code. It allows you to identify and respond to potential problems in a controlled and predictable manner, rather than allowing them to cause your program to crash.

                In Swift, errors are represented by values of types that conform to the Error protocol. When a function encounters an error, it can throw an error using the throw statement. The error can then be caught and handled by a surrounding do-catch statement.

                Regardless of what framework or tool that’s used to build a given UI, finding a good way to separate the structure and internal logic of our various views from the styles that are being applied to them is often key in order to make UI code easier to maintain and manage.
                
                While certain technologies offer a quite natural way of separating those two aspects of UI development, such as how websites declare their structure through HTML and their styles using CSS — when it comes to SwiftUI, it might not initially seem like that kind of separation is practical, or even encouraged.
                
                However, if we start exploring SwiftUI’s various APIs and conventions a bit further, it turns out that there are a number of tools and techniques that we can use to create a clean separation between our view hierarchy, its styles, and the components that we’re looking to reuse across a given project.

                In almost every application there are cases where you will declare variables as optional. In Swift we declare a value as optional be using the ?. When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely "unwrap" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).

                A common use case would be that multiple requests for asynchronous work may be issued, but only the latest request is really needed. For example, requests could be aimed at loading images from a remote source. A user might tap on a button to load the image but may decide to move on and tap on another button to load another image before the first request is even completed. In this case, subscriptions in Combine can be configured with a .switchToLatest() operator to receive a new publisher from the upstream publisher and cancel its previous subscription.

                From the official Apple documentation, a modifier is what you apply to a view or another view modifier, producing a different version of the original value.
                
                In SwiftUI, modifiers are one of the building blocks of how we create our user interfaces. They allow us to modify the Views we place on the UI visually, to add behaviors to our interface components, and to insert a view into another view structure.

                If you've ever encountered an iOS app that fails to display content due to network issues or empty data sets you might have seen a "content unavailable" view.
                
                This view was introduced in iOS 17 both in SwiftUI and UIKit to indicate that the content cannot be displayed.
                
                It's typically displayed in the following scenarios:
                - When you have an empty list of elements
                - When the detail view of a NavigationSplitView has nothing selected
                - When a search doesn't return any results
                - When there is no internet connection

                Visual effects are powerful tools used for improving the aesthetics and usability of applications. Their usage is crucial when it comes to creating engaging and visually appealing interfaces while keeping them dynamic and responsive to interactions, ensuring both clarity and accessibility.
                
                Visual effects are used on application and operational system levels in more places than we imagine. Here are some examples of how visual effects improve the user experience:
                
                - Adjusting blurs, shadows, materials, or the scaling of UI components can create a sense of depth and layering. It establishes a clear visual hierarchy by highlighting key elements on the screen, maintaining context, and enhancing readability.
                
                - The visual feedback from user interactions - rendered as adjusting brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, opacity, scaling, rotation, etc. - emphasizes user actions or changes in the app's state.
                
                - They are also employed in the creation of smooth transitions between different parts of the app, making navigation feel natural and fluid.

                Applications, in order to deliver value to their user, often rely on user-generated data to work with. A reminders app needs reminders, a calendar app needs events, a contacts app needs contact information, and apps that rely on tracking, in general, need the user to input the information in the app.

                Forms serve as the backbone of user interaction, presenting an interface for data entry. They are everywhere, whether it’s signing up for a service, making a purchase, or providing feedback.

                In iOS 17 and later, you can use the onKeyPress(_:action:) method to make a view respond to a physical keyboard event. It detects when a key is pressed and lets you perform actions based on it.
            
                To take advantage of this method, be sure the view is focusable.

                When designing our app, we must carefully choose the components to implement, understand their purpose, and determine when and how they should be used. One of the most commonly used components for app navigation is the tab bar. This enables what is often called flat navigation, allowing users to access different sections of the app by simply tapping on a specific tab.
            
                With the SwiftUI framework, implementing this type of component is as straightforward as it gets because developers can use the built-in tab bar with just a few lines of code. This not only simplifies our work but also ensures users enjoy a consistent experience across all apps installed on their devices.
            
                Of course, different devices require different kinds of experiences. We will have an overview of how tabs behave in the different operating systems and how to implement the tab bar within an app.

                Learn everything you need to know to create custom SF Symbols for your applications.
            
                Introduced in 2019 with 1,000 symbols, the SF Symbols library has since grown exponentially, reaching a substantial 6,000 symbols over six years. These symbols are designed to integrate seamlessly with Apple’s San Francisco font, ensuring visual consistency across apps. This enhances user familiarity, promotes intuitive navigation, and creates a smoother experience across devices.
            
                With the extensive variety SF Symbols offers, it's rare not to find a symbol that fits your app's needs. The comprehensive collection caters to a wide range of use cases, reducing the necessity to design icons from scratch.
            
                However, there is always room for customization: if a specific symbol isn't available, for instance, icons can be exported into vector graphics editing tools, modified, or created entirely from scratch, maintaining the shared design language and accessibility features of the existing library. This flexibility ensures that app interfaces can be unique and consistent with Apple's design standards.
            
                There are many ways to create a new custom symbol and despite which of these ways is going to be used, the process always follows the same structure:
                - Create the symbol.
                    = Optionally, you can customize it to have more control over its rendering behavior.
                - Get the file ready to be used in the Xcode.
                - Use the symbols in a SwiftUI view.
            
                Let’s explore this process.

                Date is the type we use to handle calendar information in Swift. It stores all the information needed to represent a specific point in time, independent of any calendar or time zone, by representing a time interval relative to an absolute reference date.
            
            In an application’s user interface, it is common to handle dates and times by picking specific calendar values to represent the date. A user will usually choose a day, a month, an hour, or a minute, for example and then your application will have to transform that value into a valid Date value.
            
            That’s where DateComponents comes in handy. It allows you to represent a date or time in terms of units, which can then be evaluated in a calendar system and time zone.

                Built-in layouts work great for common patterns, but they have limitations. For example, VStack and HStack only allow linear arrangements, LazyVGrid allows fixed column structures, ZStack is only about simple layering without intelligent positioning and GeometryReader can give performance issues and requires complex calculations.
            
                Custom layouts in SwiftUI are types that define the geometry of a collection of views. Instead of relying on the predefined behavior of built-in layouts, you can create your own layout logic that positions views exactly where you want them.

                The NavigationStack(root:) default initializer sets the root of your navigation hierarchy and handles the navigation path behind the scenes. If you want more control over the navigation path and enable a programmatic approach to your navigation, you can store it with a @State variable and pass it to the NavigationStack(path:root:) initializer. The path parameter needs to be of Binding<Data> type and there are two ways you can use it.
