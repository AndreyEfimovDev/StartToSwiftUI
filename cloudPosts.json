When a function encounters an error, it can throw an error using the throw statement. The error can then be caught and handled by a surrounding do-catch statement.",

Implementing an .actionSheet() is very similar to the .alert() which we learned the last video of the SwiftUI Bootcamp, however, the action sheet pops up from the bottom and can support more than 2 buttons! In this video we will learn how to implement and customize the .actionSheet to make it adaptable and dynamic.",

    "intro" : "In almost every application there are cases where you will declare variables as optional. In Swift we declare a value as optional be using the ?. When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).",

In this quick video, we will learn how to use the .textSelection modifier! This feature probably did not need it's own video, but I think it's a pretty important feature to know about. This is great for chat apps or any content-based app where users might want to share some text with a friend. Sharing is not only a great feature for your users, but will help drive organic growth as users share with others.",
