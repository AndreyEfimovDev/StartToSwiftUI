    "intro" : "Regardless of what framework or tool that’s used to build a given UI, finding a good way to separate the structure and internal logic of our various views from the styles that are being applied to them is often key in order to make UI code easier to maintain and manage.\n\nWhile certain technologies offer a quite natural way of separating those two aspects of UI development, such as how websites declare their structure through HTML and their styles using CSS — when it comes to SwiftUI, it might not initially seem like that kind of separation is practical, or even encouraged.\n\nHowever, if we start exploring SwiftUI’s various APIs and conventions a bit further, it turns out that there are a number of tools and techniques that we can use to create a clean separation between our view hierarchy, its styles, and the components that we’re looking to reuse across a given project.\n\nThat’s exactly what we’ll take a look at in this week’s article.",

    "intro" : "In almost every application there are cases where you will declare variables as optional. In Swift we declare a value as optional be using the ?. When we do this, we are telling Xcode that this variable has the potential to be nil (or without a value). Therefore, when we go to use that variable in our code, we need to safely check whether or not it really has a value at that time. Two of the smartest and safest ways to safely \"unwrap\" these optionals is be using 'if let' and 'guard' statements. In this video we will learn both! It should be noted that both of these methods are MUCH safer than explicitly unwrapping optionals by using the ! symbol (avoid this!).",

This is great for chat apps or any content-based app where users might want to share some text with a friend.
